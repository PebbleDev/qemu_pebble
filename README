QEMU with STM32 Microcontroller Implementation

Official Homepage: http://beckus.github.io/qemu_stm32/

OVERVIEW
This is a copy of QEMU that has been modified to include an implementation
of the STM32 microcontroller.  It also implements an Olimex STM32_P103
developmentvboard.  This project runs the demos located in the
stm32_p103_demos project located at: https://github.com/beckus/stm32_p103_demos .

Commands for a typical build:
./configure --enable-debug --target-list="arm-softmmu"
make

Useful make commands when rebuilding:
    make defconfig
    make clean

The generated executable is arm-softmmu/qemu-system-arm .

Other configure options which control the STM32 implementation:

    --extra-cflags=-DDEBUG_CLKTREE
        Print out clock tree debug statements.

    --extra-cflags=-DDEBUG_STM32_RCC
        Print RCC debug statements.

    --extra-cflags=-DDEBUG_STM32_UART
        Print UART debug statements.

    --extra-cflags=-DSTM32_UART_NO_BAUD_DELAY
        Disable the BAUD rate timing simulation
        (i.e. the UART will transmit or receive as fast as possible, rather than
        using a realistic delay).

    --extra-cflags=-DSTM32_UART_ENABLE_OVERRUN
        Enable setting of the overrun flag if a character is
        received before the last one is processed.  If this is not set, the UART
        will not receive the next character until the previous one is read by
        software.  Although less realisitic, this is safer in case the VM is
        running slow.

Other QEMU configure options which are useful for troubleshooting:
    --extra-cflags=-DDEBUG_GIC

qemu-system-arm options which are useful for trobuleshooting:
    -d ?
        To see available log levels

    -d cpu,in_asm
        Enable logging to view the CPU state during execution and the ARM
        instructions which are being executed.  I believe --enable-debug must be
        used for this to work.
        By default, you can find the output in /tmp/qemu.log:

UNIT TESTING
Unit test scripts are included for the STM32 implementation.
These test will be executed when running "make" with the standard
check targets (see tests/Makefile for documentation of QEMU's unit
testing features):
    make check
    make check-qtest-arm
